HomePortal
==========

HomePortal is a my own home management application. It is a PHP and MySQL system that allows me to manage money, contacts, calendar events, tasks, notes and inventory items.

While I have been running it in one form or another for a number of years this is the closest it has got to release ready. That being said it is not quite release ready. I still have to go into the database from time to time and the numbers that come out have not been verified by a third party.

Any feedback, bug reports and feature requests are more than welcome, although don't get your hopes up.

At this point the code is provided as is on the condition that it is only used for personal use and any changes are push back to the community.
